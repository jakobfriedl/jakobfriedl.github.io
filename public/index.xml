      <title>High-Level Red Team Training: Cybernetics &amp; APTLabs Review</title>

      <description>A few months ago, I published a blog post where I reviewed the first three HackTheBox Pro Labs that I completed in summer 2023: Offshore, RastaLabs and Zephyr. Over the winter months of this year, I took on the challenge to complete the two remaining advanced labs: Cybernetics and APTLabs. They are both rated as highly challenging, realistic and modern training environments for red team operators and penetration testers. In this blog post, I want to share the journey I went through while completing these labs with my good friend and colleague Leo and I&amp;rsquo;m going to give a brief review of the labs themselves and my opinion on them.</description>

      <title>Kerberos Authentication Protocol</title>
      <link>https://jakobfriedl.github.io/blog/kerberos/</link>

      <description>The Kerberos protocol provides a single-sign-on (SSO) mutual authentication solution for insecure networks or hosts, where clients and servers verify each others identity based on symmetric-key cryptography and a ticket-based authentication system. Most commonly used in Windows Active Directory environments, a user only has to enter their password once to be able to access a multitude of servers, shares or other resources, while the password is never directly sent across the network, unlike in less secure alternatives like NTLM.</description>

      <description>During the summer months of July and August of 2023 I had the opportunity to complete three of the six buyable HackTheBox Pro Lab certifications: Offshore, a Penetration Tester Level 3 lab, as well as RastaLabs and Zephyr, both of which are Red Team Operator Level 1 certifications respectively. In this blog post I want to outline my experiences, struggles and learning outcomes of these labs and provide my personal opinion on them.</description>
