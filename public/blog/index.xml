      <description>Malware is a constantly evolving threat that is becoming more and more sophisticated. One of the most advanced types of malware is metamorphic malware. Metamorphic malware is a type of malware that is able to change its code and structure every time it is executed, making it extremely difficult to detect and analyze. In this blog post, I will discuss the state of metamorphic malware, how it works, and the challenges it poses to security researchers and analysts.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I published a blog post where I reviewed the first three HackTheBox Pro Labs that I completed in summer 2023: Offshore, RastaLabs and Zephyr. Over the winter months of this year, I took on the challenge to complete the two remaining advanced labs: Cybernetics and APTLabs. They are both rated as highly challenging, realistic and modern training environments for red team operators and penetration testers. In this blog post, I want to share the journey I went through while completing these labs with my good friend and colleague Leo and I&amp;rsquo;m going to give a brief review of the labs themselves and my opinion on them.</description>

      <description>During the summer months of July and August of 2023 I had the opportunity to complete three of the six buyable HackTheBox Pro Lab certifications: Offshore, a Penetration Tester Level 3 lab, as well as RastaLabs and Zephyr, both of which are Red Team Operator Level 1 certifications respectively. In this blog post I want to outline my experiences, struggles and learning outcomes of these labs and provide my personal opinion on them.</description>
